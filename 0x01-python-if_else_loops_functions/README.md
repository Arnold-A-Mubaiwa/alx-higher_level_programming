#### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.

You can only use one print function with string format
You can only use one loop in your code
You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module

#### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use one print function with string format
